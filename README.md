A robust appointment scheduling and CRM application for a global team.

The software includes a multilingual login form, customer record management (add, update, delete), and appointment handling linked to customer records. It allows calendar viewing by month and week, auto-adjusts appointment times based on user time zones and daylight saving time, and incorporates exception controls to prevent various issues.

A MySQL database is used on the backend for querying user and appointment information.

The system sends reminders 15 minutes before appointments based on user logins and generates reports, tracking user activity by recording timestamps in a .txt file.
